# my_basecamp_3

This project (over three different stages) replicates the functionality of the popular project management software Basecamp.
Built with a team equally sharing the work across front and back end, this was our first experience developing a web app with Ruby on Rails.
It includes ability to create an account, create/edit projects and add team members, add attachments (text or images), initiate discussion threads, and assign tasks.  There are different permissions that can be granted to team members of a specific project.
