# my_basecamp_3

This project (over three different stages) replicates the functionality of the popular project management software Basecamp.
This was a small group project build equally sharing the work across front and back end, and for each of us it was the first experience developing a web app with Ruby on Rails.   Our Basecamp includes ability to create an authenticated account, create/edit projects and add team members, add attachments (text or images), initiate discussion threads, and assign tasks.  There are different permissions that can be granted to team members of a specific project.
